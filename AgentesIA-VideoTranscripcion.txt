0:00 - Whenever I see a complex AI agent or
workflow like this, I get a headache.
0:04 - Yes, they look super impressive on the
screen, but in reality, the more complex
0:09 - your workflow is often less effective.
0:11 - They're harder to maintain, debug
or test or just make it harder to
0:15 - scale and even more, it makes you
think that AI agents have to be
0:19 - very technical, look complicated in
order to be considered high value.
0:24 - So in this video, let's
change this mindset.
0:27 - I'll share a much simple and easy
way to build not just a single
0:31 - AI agent, but eventually building
your AI work team with scalability.
0:36 - Even if you are non-technical
like me, let's go.
0:41 - Don't let AI agents scare you.
0:42 - What makes AI agents different is
they make decision with reasoning.
0:46 - It has access to tools, memory,
so it can analyze a situations
0:51 - and choose what to do next.
0:52 - While a workflow or automation just
execute the same sequence every time.
0:57 - I cover this in details in my
previous video, so go watch it.
1:01 - And what makes an AI agent truly effective
is not about how many nodes it has, but
1:06 - with these clearly defined elements.
1:08 - First role and responsibility,
what exactly this agent does.
1:12 - Second tools, what tools or external data
it can access and use, and then input
1:18 - what is the required input from the user.
1:20 - Workflow details.
1:21 - This is super important as it will make
the agent's behavior much more reliable.
1:26 - Important guardrails.
1:28 - What are the boundaries
and must-follow rules?
1:30 - Output format, what is the output
look like or success criteria?
1:34 - You can even include things like
error handling, how it will handle
1:37 - different unexpected situations.
1:39 - So the more details you define, the
better will be the agent quality.
1:43 - Another important note is that you'll
need an API key from those AI models
1:47 - or service provider in order to
connect your agents to these systems.
1:51 - So take some time to set up all those
API keys before you start building.
1:55 - For example, like perplexity,
you need to create a separate new
1:58 - API key for your agent's access.
2:01 - So here is my simple three step framework
to build your AI work team using what
2:05 - I call a building block approach.
2:07 - First, map your workflow.
2:09 - Identify two to three repetitive or
key tasks in your daily work process.
2:13 - Is it research, copywriting,
data analysis, or anything else.
2:17 - The key is to keep them distinct enough.
2:20 - Next design your AI agents
or specialized AI assistant.
2:24 - We'll be using an AI agent
designer to design whatever AI agents we
2:28 - want, which I'll show you in a minute.
2:30 - And finally we'll add a manager agent.
2:32 - So this is like your ultimate work
assistant that helps you to delegate
2:35 - and coordinate different tasks
between different AI assistant.
2:39 - So each AI assistant is like a
block or specialized module where
2:43 - you can plug to this manager at
any time to ensure scalability.
2:47 - For this video, I'll be using
the no-code platform n8n.
2:50 - It's good for non-technicals, but
the same concept applies to other
2:54 - no-code AI agents building platforms.
2:56 - Now if you are also thinking about
building AI agents for your organization,
3:00 - I want to share this free ebook,
Master AI Agents from HubSpot.
3:04 - I've put the download
link in the description.
3:06 - This eBook focus on the
strategic side of AI agents.
3:09 - It's designed for anyone looking to deploy
AI agents at scale in their business.
3:14 - It covers the current state of
AI agents, high impact use cases
3:17 - across marketing, sales, and
operations with real world examples.
3:22 - So you get more AI agents
ideas you can build.
3:24 - You'll also learn how to identify
some proven low risk starting point
3:28 - to deploy AI agents, common pitfalls,
and even a practical checklist to
3:33 - guide your organization through
each stage of the implementation.
3:37 - What I like is that it comes with a
step-by-step execution roadmap so you
3:41 - have a clear directions on the important
areas to focus on at each stage.
3:45 - I recommend you download this
in a description below for free.
3:48 - And thank you hotspot for
sponsoring this video.
3:50 - Alright.
3:50 - Now we'll use this framework to build
a three agent work team in this work
3:54 - team demo we'll have a manager, and
underneath we have a competitive research
3:59 - agent and a data visualization agent.
4:01 - What kind of agent doesn't really matter.
4:03 - What's more important is you know,
the concept behind, so you can use the
4:08 - same method to build your AI work team.
4:10 - ********
Let's start with the research agent first.
4:12 - So we will have this AI designer to
help us to design the AI agent prompt.
4:16 - So you can use whatever AI models
like ChatGPT, Gemini, but make
4:20 - sure it is a reasoning model
for more thoughtful outputs.
4:22 - And we will use this project
instructions to generate a set
4:25 - of ready to use system prompt for
whatever agents we're going to build.
4:29 - So I would just describe
what I want this agent to do.
4:31 - For example, it will use perplexity to
do research and create a Google Doc and
4:36 - then return the document link to me.
4:38 - So you can see the agent prompt output
is really detailed and it will give you
4:41 - the proposed list of tool access as well.
4:44 - But make sure to review and
make adjustment and never
4:46 - just accept what it gives you.
4:48 - Now we are ready to create this
agent on n8n, create a new workflow.
4:53 - Let's just call it competitive
research agent, then add an AI agent.
4:57 - Now you can see clearly the
structure of an AI agent.
5:00 - We have model, memory and tools,
and let's do it one by one.
5:04 - For AI models, I'll just
pick Claude Sonnet 4.
5:07 - But you can pick whatever model
that you want, but note that for
5:10 - every model service, you must
set up the credential first.
5:13 - And then add the memory.
5:14 - So memory is not mandatory, but it's
super beneficial since it allows the
5:19 - agent to retrieve or update knowledge
and learning into your own database.
5:23 - But for the sake of demo, we
will just keep it simple and
5:26 - use the simple memory tool.
5:28 - So keep the default context window
length to five, and that means
5:32 - the agent will only retain the
last five messages at maximum.
5:36 - Now according to the system prompt,
we will add three tools, the
5:39 - perplexity search, Google Doc read
function, and the write function.
5:43 - First let's add the perplexity node.
5:45 - For the sake of demo, I'll just pick the
sonar mode it is most cost effective, but
5:49 - you may want to use Sonar Deep research
if you want more in-depth research.
5:53 - As for the message, we'll
let the AI model to decide.
5:55 - So once done, you can test it just
to make sure everything is connecting
5:59 - properly with a testing query so
you can see it's working fine.
6:03 - And next we'll add the Google Doc
node for reading company information.
6:07 - Under the operations we
will need the get function.
6:10 - So let's say I have this company
information about my brand Miro and I
6:14 - want the agent to always access this
information as part of the research.
6:19 - So just copy this document link
and then paste it back on n8n.
6:23 - Again, test it quickly and you can see
the content is retrieved successfully.
6:27 - Now add another Google Doc.
6:28 - Create function.
6:29 - So keep all the same settings,
but this time pick "Create" under
6:33 - operation, pick the right folder name.
6:36 - So this will be the folder that this
research agent will save the report.
6:40 - For the title,
6:41 - we will leave to the
AI model to the decide.
6:43 - So let test it by creating a testing
document so it will return the
6:47 - document id, that means it's working.
6:49 - And then also add one more Google
doc node for the update function.
6:53 - For the document ID and the
actual body content, we will
6:56 - let the AI model to decide.
6:58 - Also, rename them to keep it organized.
7:00 - Now the final step is to add the
system prompt for this AI agent.
7:04 - So whenever we trigger the
workflow, it knows what to do.
7:07 - So click on the AI agent, under
option pick system message.
7:11 - So here you can define the system prompt
for this AI agents and then we can paste
7:15 - back the system prompt we just generated.
7:17 - Note I have simplified it and to keep
the final report length, no more than
7:21 - 800 words just to showcase the demo.
7:24 - Now the agent is ready.
7:25 - Let's try this prompt to ask it
to research about Figma, including
7:29 - the business model, key products
and market position, and how it
7:33 - impacts our strategy at Miro.
7:35 - So you can see it would trigger all
the nodes starting from perplexity,
7:39 - and you can always click the log to
see the details or in case any errors
7:44 - occurred, it is super helpful to debug.
7:46 - Then immediately the insights is ready
with recommendations and the report
7:50 - link where you can open, and this is
amazing with the title and key sections.
7:56 - And you can always adjust the
report length, formatting, beautify
8:00 - it using the system prompt.
8:01 - The only complaint I have is it
didn't went through the Miro document.
8:05 - So this is the good chance
for you to review the system
8:08 - prompt and to make improvement.
8:10 - And the best thing is the whole process
just took me less than 15 minutes.
8:14 - So don't think AI agents
have to be super complicated.
8:18 - Now we are not done yet to make
an AI work team that should
8:21 - be more than one AI assistant.
8:23 - So this time we are going to build
another data visualization agent
8:27 - and it is easier than you think.
8:29 - ******
So we will first ask the AI agent
designer to generate a set of system
8:32 - prompt for this visualization agent.
8:34 - For this agent.
8:35 - It will turn any Google Doc
report link into a visualization
8:40 - dashboard and send an email to me.
8:42 - And you can see the generated
system prompt is super detailed, but
8:45 - always make changes using your own
judgment to see if that makes sense.
8:49 - Now create a new workflow on n8n
and call it visualization agent.
8:53 - So I will keep using the Claude Sonnet 4
model, but this time also set the maximum
8:58 - number of tokens to at least 8,000.
9:01 - As for visualization generation types
of tasks, it usually requires more
9:05 - tokens to avoid message output cutoff.
9:07 - And then also add the memory tool.
9:10 - For the tools according to the system
prompt, we'll need the Google Doc
9:13 - for retrieving the report content
and Gmail to send the email.
9:17 - So first, add the Google document nodes
for reading reports and let AI to decide
9:21 - the document ID and always test it.
9:24 - And then also add the Gmail
node for sending emails.
9:27 - Pick the send function, and set
recipient, subjects and body message
9:31 - to be decided by the AI model.
9:33 - And in case you're building an agent
that needs to get email, reply email,
9:38 - you must add them one by one again,
test it by sending a testing email.
9:42 - And then finally paste back the system
instructions for these AI agents we just
9:47 - So everything is ready now.
9:48 - We can try to ask it to prepare
the dashboard for this Figma
9:51 - research report we just generated.
9:53 - And then you can see it is
executing the nodes from Google
9:57 - Documents and then back to Claude
for generating the visualization.
10:01 - And then finally sending the email.
10:03 - And then within a minute it says
the email has been sent with the
10:06 - actions it took for the visuals.
10:07 - I also received the email and I
like the email subject line, and the
10:11 - email is exactly what I want with
the typical visual style from Claude.
10:15 - And you can always adjust the
dashboard format, like color, style,
10:19 - width, or adding additional message
using the agent system prompt.
10:23 - So with no more than 10 minutes,
we have built this simple agent
10:27 - to do all kinds of visualization
and communication tasks for you.
10:31 - You can adapt this for any
recurring data visualization or
10:35 - stakeholder communication needs.
10:36 - You can even connect to your Google
Sheets or Google Drive folder,
10:40 - so there's so many possibilities.
10:42 - Okay, we are ready to
build our AI work team.
10:45 - So we will have a manager agent about
these two AI assistant, and it will help
10:49 - to delegate and coordinate the work tasks.
10:52 - So this manager is just like your ultimate
work assistant managing your team.
10:56 - ******
First, let's quickly create a
system prompt for this manager and
10:59 - describe its major role to delegate
the tasks, then make adjustment as
11:04 - needed and save it for later use.
11:06 - Now before adding the manager
agent, we will first need to make
11:09 - some small tweaks to the two AI
assistant as we going to connect
11:13 - these two assistant to the AI manager.
11:16 - So on the research agent first remove
the memory as the memory is going to be
11:20 - maintained at the manager level, and also
just to make things easier to manage.
11:25 - And second remove the
chat message trigger.
11:28 - So that is because we no longer
directly work with this assistant, but
11:32 - to delegate it to the upper manager.
11:34 - So we will pick the node "When
executed by another workflow",
11:38 - and that means this research agent
will now receive command from the
11:42 - manager agent we are going to create.
11:45 - And then we'll define a field,
just give it a name called query,
11:48 - and the name is totally up to you.
11:50 - And then connect it to this agent.
11:53 - And finally click this AI Agents.
11:55 - We'll change the prompt message
field for this AI Agent as we no
11:58 - longer use the chat input trigger.
12:00 - So under the source for prompts, select
define below, click expressions and
12:05 - type {{$json.query}}, which is the query
field we just defined, and then save it.
12:10 - And then repeat the same and make the
same changes for the visualization agent.
12:14 - Once you are done, we are going
to create a manager agent.
12:17 - Again, add a new AI agent.
12:19 - Repeat the same process to add
the AI models and simple memory.
12:23 - For the tools, this will be connected
to the two AI assistant we just created.
12:27 - So this manager will supervise these two
assistant and route the tasks when needed.
12:32 - So in the tool list, search
for Call n8n Workflow Tool.
12:36 - So these node allow us to trigger any
existing agent workflow we have created.
12:42 - So under the list, let's first select
the research agent, and then you
12:46 - will see there is a field called
query under the workflow input.
12:50 - So that is the field we just defined.
12:52 - And then also rename it as
research agents, just to make
12:55 - things clear and organized.
12:57 - And then also do the same for
the visualization agent by adding
13:00 - another trigger workflow tool.
13:02 - Now we are almost done.
13:03 - The last thing is to add back the
system prompt for this manager agent.
13:07 - So paste back the system prompt we
just created and then click save.
13:11 - Okay.
13:11 - This is so exciting.
13:12 - Let's try this prompt to ask it to
research about the brand FigJam, and
13:17 - at the same time to visualize the
report insights and send it to me.
13:21 - So you can see it would immediately
call the research agent and then to
13:25 - the visualization agent, it is all
handled by this manager and after
13:30 - around four minutes , it returned
output for me and it looks great.
13:34 - You can see the manager specified
how each of the tasks are handled and
13:38 - with the report link, which is nice,
and it ensures everything has been
13:42 - delivered at the end of the message.
13:44 - and we can just click the
link to open the report.
13:47 - And it looks the same as if we are
directly working with this research agent
13:51 - and also the email with the dashboard.
13:53 - It looks amazing with all the
report details, the charts, the
13:58 - visual storytelling elements.
14:00 - And so now you already have this
small AI work team, and the best thing
14:04 - is using this method is much more
scalable in case you want to add a new
14:09 - assistant or AI workflow to this team,
you can just add it to the manager.
14:14 - And remember, each assistant
should be simple, so it's much
14:17 - more easy to manage and maintain.
14:20 - And you can even enable the public
chat with the authentication.
14:23 - So you really like having a dedicated
manager to manage your work process.
14:28 - So don't think you need to make
AI agents super complex to start
14:32 - generating values for your work.
14:34 - A simple system is always the
most reliable and scalable.
